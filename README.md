Aman don't sneak in here.


## Developing

There are files in the repo to support opening the repository as an [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
project. The project can be run by navigating to `Main.java`, right clicking
and selecting `Run 'Main.main()'` (or press `ctrl+shift+F10`). It should auto
save that run configuration so you can click `Run` from the main menus or global
keyboard shortcut.

Could be a different process for other IDEs; maybe we should find a standard build
system?
